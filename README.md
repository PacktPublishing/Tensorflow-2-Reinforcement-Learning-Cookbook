This is the code repository for [TensorFlow 2 Reinforcement Learning Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/product/tensorflow-2-reinforcement-learning-cookbook/9781838982546?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781838982546), published by Packt.

**Over 50 recipes to help you build, train, and deploy learning agents for real-world applications**

## What is this book about?

With deep reinforcement learning, you can build intelligent agents, products, and services that can go beyond computer vision or perception to perform actions. TensorFlow 2.x is the latest major release of the most popular deep learning framework used to develop and train deep neural networks (DNNs). This book contains easy-to-follow recipes for leveraging TensorFlow 2.x to develop artificial intelligence applications.

Starting with an introduction to the fundamentals of deep reinforcement learning and TensorFlow 2.x, the book covers OpenAI Gym, model-based RL, model-free RL, and how to develop basic agents. You'll discover how to implement advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithms such as actor-critic, deep deterministic policy gradients, deep-Q networks, proximal policy optimization, and deep recurrent Q-networks for training your RL agents. As you advance, you’ll explore the applications of reinforcement learning by building cryptocurrency trading agents, stock/share trading agents, and intelligent agents for automating task completion. Finally, you'll find out how to deploy deep reinforcement learning agents to the cloud and build cross-platform apps using TensorFlow 2.x.

By the end of this TensorFlow book, you'll be able to:

## Getting Started

It is advised to create and use a Python virtual environment named `tfrl-cookbook` to install the packages and run the code in this book. A Miniconda or Anaconda installation for Python virtual environment management is recommended. Follow these steps to set up a conda pyton virtual environment using `miniconda`:

1. Install system dependencies:
   - Linux (Ubuntu/Debian): `sudo apt install -y make cmake ffmpeg`
   - Mac OSX: `brew install make cmake ffmpeg`
2. Install miniconda: `wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh && bash -b -p ${HOME}/miniconda3`
3. Setup conda python virtual environment: `bash && conda env create -f tfrl-cookbook.yml -n "tfrl-cookbook"`
   You are all set!
4. Activate the `tfrl-cookbook` conda python environment: `conda activate tfrl-cookbook` and get started with the recipes in the book!

It is highly recommended to star and fork the GitHub repository to receive updates and improvements to the code recipes.We urge you to share what you build and also engage with other readers and the community [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Tensorflow-2-Reinforcement-Learning-Cookbook/discussions).

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-9).
